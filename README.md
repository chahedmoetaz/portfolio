# My Portfolio 
![Preview](/1.png)

## Introduction üëã

My Portfolio is built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a modern design and rapid development. TypeScript is utilized for code clarity and safety. Additionally, Firebase is being integrated for backend services such as realtime-database. The result is a dynamic and functional portfolio website that showcases the developer's skills and experience.

   ```
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=XXXXXXXX
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=XXXXXXXXXX

   MAIL_TO=YOUR_MAIL_ID
   ```
   <!-- write text to tell user to get sendgrid keys from dashboard and add here -->

> **Note**: `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - Create an API key from "Settings" -> "API Keys" with "Restricted Access" to only "Mail Send"

   - Go to "Database" -> "Realtime Database" -> "Import JSON" and import the [data.json](https://github.com/chahedmoetaz/My-Portfolio/blob/main/data.json) file

3. Run the project

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
